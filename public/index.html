			Fix Mac OS X DNS Failure on UPC Router</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>About a week ago, I upgraded my MacBook Pro to OS X 10.6.4. Since then, I&#8217;ve had trouble with the internet
connection <strong>only</strong> from my house and <strong>only</strong> on my MBP. Sometimes the connection would work fine, but
most of the time Firefox/Safari would only load the first couple of pages and then new pages would start to
time out.</p>

<p>Since I could ping/view a site by going to the server&#8217;s IP address directly, the issue appeared to be with
the MBP resolving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>. DNS is how your computer translates a human readable URL such as
<strong>andyregan.net</strong> to a machine readable IP address.</p>

<p>Since the problem was <strong>only</strong> with my UPC connection (router is Cisco EPC2425), I thought changing DNS
provider to <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/">Google</a> or <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> might do the trick. Alas, the new DNS servers would work for the
first few pages and then pages started timing out again.</p>

<p>After poking around the (extremely limited) options on the UPC router, I noticed that there were a ton of
firewall blocks for the 192.168.1.0/24 network over the last week. Devices connecting to the router, such
as my MBP, are assigned IP addresses within this range.</p>

<p>On closer inspection, I discovered that the router&#8217;s firewall was blocking the MBP from the DNS servers
for <strong>LAN-side UDP Flood</strong>. I turned off the router&#8217;s firewall and restarted it. Et voila! Bob&#8217;s your
uncle.</p>

<p>My guess is that the firewall blocks must be due to some change in DNS behavior since the last OS X
update. Posting here to save some poor soul the heartache. It&#8217;s important to note that turning off your
router&#8217;s firewall is at your own risk.</p>

			Setting Up a New CakePHP Environment in Ubuntu</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://cakephp.org"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/setting-up-a-new-cakephp-environment-in-ubuntu/cakephp_logo_250_trans-150x150.png" width="150" title="CakePHP Logo" alt="CakePHP Logo"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> is a useful <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/MVC">MVC</a> framework for PHP applications. However, there are a few common gotchas when setting up a new development
environment. In this post, I will go through how to get around these issues when setting up a new environment on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</a> (Linux Apache
MySQL PHP) server, in this case server running an <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> OS. Please leave a comment if you have any feedback or
can recommend any improvements on the suggestions here.</p>

<h2>Grab a Copy and Get Started</h2>

<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll need to do is <a href="http://compsoc.nuigalway.ie/wiki/how_to:apache">get a local LAMP server up and running</a>. Then, grab
a fresh copy of CakePHP from <a href="http://cakephp.org">cakephp.org</a>. This site also has some useful resources if you&#8217;d like to learn more about the framework.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Grab the source </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>wget http://download.github.com/cakephp-cakephp1x-ef18ab2.tar.gz
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once you have downloaded the tarball, extract it and then rename the new directory to something more useful. This is the root directory of
the application.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Extract the source </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>tar -xvvzf cakephp-cakephp1x-ef18ab2.tar.gz
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>mv cakephp-cakephp1x-ef18ab2/ cake_project/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Make Tmp/ Writable</h2>

<p>Next, you need to make sure that the <strong>tmp/</strong> directory is writeable. To avoid using insecure 777 permissions, I recommend installing <a href="http://www.suphp.org/Home.html">suPHP</a>.
SuPHP allows PHP scripts to be run as their owner rather than as the default Apache user (<strong>www-data</strong>). As a result, you can use more secure
file and directory permissions while still allowing the <strong>tmp/</strong> directory to be writeable by the application. Generally, 755 permissions
are sufficiently secure for directories and 644 for files.</p>

<p>Install the correct packages, enable <strong>suphp</strong> and disable the <strong>php5</strong> module.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Prepare the Environment </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-suphp suphp-common
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo a2enmod suphp;sudo a2dismod php5;sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Add A Dash of Salt</h2>

<p>With that out of the way, now you need to change the default salt value for the application. CakePHP needs a random string (&#8220;salt&#8221;) which is
used to generate secure hashes. I find the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/pwgen">pwgen</a> utility in Linux very useful for quickly generating a random string.</p>

<p>Open up <strong>app/config/core.php</strong>. Then, replace the <strong>random_string</strong> value below with the output of the <strong>pwgen</strong> command .</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>app/config/core.php </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">Configure::write(&#39;Security.salt&#39;, &#39;random_string&#39;);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Prepare the Environment </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>pwgen -y 100
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Point Your Domain at the Cake Directory</h2>

<p>You can use Apache&#8217;s <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.1/mod/mod_userdir.html">userdir</a> module to test your application. This will allow you to go to <strong>http://yourdomain.com/~username&#8221;</strong> in your
browser where <strong>/home/username/public_html</strong> is the document root. However, this often conflicts with the Apache <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html">rewrite</a> module which
is necessary for &#8220;friendly&#8221; URLs.</p>

<p>To get around this conflict on a local development environment, I recommend pointing your domain at the application&#8217;s root directory. In
this way, when you go to the domain in your browser it will show you the newly installed CakePHP application.</p>

<p>First, add a rule to your computer&#8217;s <strong>/etc/hosts</strong> file so that the domain points to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost">localhost</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>/etc/hosts </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>127.0.0.1       caketest.com www.caketest.com
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, add and enable a <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/vhosts/">vhost</a> for the domain you are working on.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Edit the vhost </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

			Nasty Site Hack Leads to Phony Google Links</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Thar be nasty scripts here!</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="http://andyregan.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tornado_warning.gif" width="300" title="Warning Sign" alt="Thar be nasty scripts here!"></p>

<p>Came across a dirty (but interesting) website hack today. Essentially when a person googled their domain name they discovered hundreds
and hundreds of phony links pointing to a sub-directory of their site. (With various explicitly charming descriptions).
Clicking on these links displayed a page full of advertisements.</p>

<p>Had a nose around the sub-directory in question and couldn&#8217;t find any files corresponding to the links.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found a rogue PHP script (called <strong>report.php</strong>). Turns out that the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/htaccess.html">.htaccess</a> file in the directory had been modified
to redirect any <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404">404 Not Found</a></strong> errors to the PHP script. Even dirtier still was that when you accessed the script directly in a
browser it showed a typical default 404 error, a tactic I guess is there to add confusion when you are trying to find the cause of the
hack. <strong>Bastards</strong>.</p>

<p>Script was <a href="http://www.wewatchyourwebsite.com/wordpress/?p=136">base64</a>&#8216;d and full of typical randomness meant to slow down those trying to figure out exactly what it&#8217;s trying to do.
As far as I can tell, it just serves up ad pages when it&#8217;s redirected to and the 404 error page when accessed directly.</p>

<p>The ultimate bastardly thing about this hack is that even after you clean up your site, it&#8217;ll be ages before the explicit phony links
dissappear from Google. Another good reason to avoid 777 permissions of directories and keep your web software updated.</p>

<p>Just wanted to make people aware of it. If you come across something similar have a look in the <strong>.htaccess</strong> file first. :)</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>The following bash one-liner can help find any files that contain a call to the base64_encode() method. Some legitimate files may be
included, but this should help narrow down the list of dirty scripts.</p>

The new theme is based on the <a href="http://themes.jestro.com/vigilance/">Vigilance Theme</a> by <a href="http://www.jestro.com/">Jestro</a> with some tweaks suggested in an excellent <a href="http://healyourchurchwebsite.com/2008/12/01/working-with-the-wordpress-theme-vigilance-116/">article by Dean Peters</a> along with a couple of tweaks of my own.</p>

<p>Header image is a photo I took atop the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=silver+strand+galway&amp;sll=53.273797,-9.05178&amp;sspn=0.091155,0.30899&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=53.251299,-9.124403&amp;spn=0.0114,0.038624&amp;t=h&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=I">cliff at Silver Strand overlooking Galway Bay</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a lot cleaner and I think it&#8217;s easier to read, too. Hope you like it!</p>

<p>According to RTE there should be plenty of work for me and my classmates when we graduate. Good to hear. (As Forrest Gump would say, &#8220;One less thing, you know?&#8221;.) Unfortunately, from my experience so far this year I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be quite as easy to get a good job in ICT as RTE suggests.</p>

<p>The dramatic reduction in the number of people studying computer sciences courses since the dot-com bust has been no more obvious than in my own course. At the start of this decade, GY350 Information Technology was very much in demand, with hundreds of students and Round 1 CAO points regularly over 400.</p>

<p>Today, there&#8217;s <strong>nine</strong> of us in final year.</p>

<p>What caused the continuous slump in applicants? According to a <a href="http://www.forfas.ie/publications/2008/title,951,en.php">report</a> published last year by Forf&aacute;s, the national policy advisory body for enterprise and science, the mammies and guidance councilors of Ireland share a large part of the blame.</p>

<p>When the numbers of ICT jobs started to fall sharply and graduates found themselves competing to find work the mammies of Ireland took heed. The word was out that the &#8221;<em>computhers</em> game&#8221; was a lame duck.</p>

<p>Nay not so. While fewer positions were available, the revenue generated by the ICT industry continued to grow and after 2004 the number of people employed in ICT began to steadily grow again. However, the stigma of the bust was not forgotten.</p>

<p>Personally, I know a number of people who wanted to study IT but were told &#8220;sure there&#8217;s no jobs in that&#8221; and &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t you study civil engineering and make a fortune like young Gombeen down the road?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re told Ireland doesn&#8217;t have enough IT graduates to meet demand. RTE reports that &#8220;50% of software hires in Dublin are from abroad&#8221; at a time when 4000 people (including many college graduates) are applying for 280 jobs in Ikea.</p>

<p>Aside from worries about job security, I also think that people have a poor understanding of the type of work that an IT student will do once they graduate. When I&#8217;m asked what I&#8217;m studying in college, I generally have to brace myself for the inevitable &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re doing IT? Is there much work fixing computers?&#8221;. (Usually followed by a request to fix a broken printer or laptop. o_0 )</p>

<p>One of the main recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s report is &#8220;better communication of career opportunities and skills needs of the ICT sector &#8220;. I think a good effort is now being made by the government and 3rd level institutions to change people&#8217;s perceptions of ICT. Hopefully, this will lead to more applications over the coming years.</p>

<p>An unexpected side affect of the drop in demand for ICT courses was an increase in the drop out rate. The points for my course bombed from 385 in 2001 to 225 in 2002. The points began to steadily climb again, but in the proceeding years I know that some people applied for the course purely based on the low points requirement. They struggled with the course material and work load. Many failed and either repeated or dropped out.</p>

<p>Other similar courses such as Electronic Engineering experienced the same problems.</p>

<p>All this should be good news to me, right? Less competition and all that? Unfortunately, my pending departure from 3rd level education is coinciding with probably the most dramatic hic-up in the Irish and global economy.</p>

<p>Already, a number of companies well-known for hiring IT graduates have suspended hiring for the rest of the year due to &#8220;the current macro-economic environment&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t hear <em>that</em> mentioned in the RTE report.</p>

<p>I also think some companies are continuing to advertise for jobs not knowing if they will be able to actually take on new hires, probably because they don&#8217;t want to seem weak in the current climate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not expecting to fall out of my degree onto a smorgous board of opportunity waiting to snap me up. (Prove me wrong, world. Prove me wrong.) In fact, I think I&#8217;m going to have to really sell myself to land a good job where I&#8217;ll be competing against people that are out of work and who have a few year&#8217;s experience under their belts.</p>

<p>Are there plenty of jobs out there? I&#8217;m sure there is, but definitely not to the extent reported by RTE last Thursday.</p>

<p>Nathan and I attended <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/18452">DrupalCamp in Galway</a> on Saturday. John Long also made a suprise appearance! It was very well organised and over 60 people attended. Unfortunately, we could only attend on the Saturday. Many thanks and congratulations to the organisers.</p>

<p><a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> is an open source content management system with a very active contributing community. There&#8217;s a huge amount of contributed <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Modules">modules</a> available that allow users to extend the core functionality of the software. As a result, Drupal is extremely flexible and configurable.</p>

<p>Custom themes can also be easily applied. There are many free themes available at <a href="http://themegarden.org/drupal6/">themegarden.org</a>. Here&#8217;s a list of my favourites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/nitobe">nitobe</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/painted">painted</a></li>

</ul>


<h3>Complexity vs Flexibility</h3>

<p>Unfortunately for new users, the amount of configuration options available is more than a bit overwhelming. I found that performing common tasks in a new install of Drupal is not as obvious as other content management systems, such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> or <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>. Although well organised, the standard administrative interface feels overloaded with text.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to improve usability that were suggested by speakers at DrupalCamp. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu">Administration Menu</a> module provides a nice drop down navigation bar containing common admin tasks that becomes available when an administrator logs in. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rootcandy">RootCandy</a> theme is also an improvement on the default administration theme.</p>

<p>One gotcha when installing new modules is satisfying their dependent modules. You may have to track down and install dependent modules (and their dependent modules!) before you can active the original module you wanted.</p>

<p>While many “newbies” (including myself) complain about the complexity of Drupal, it was mentioned by Alan Burke yesterday that the Drupal developers do not want to improve simplicity at the cost of flexibility. At the end of the day, some basic knowledge of web development is required.</p>

<p>I think some of the group that didn&#8217;t come from a technical background were expecting a kind of <em>Word for Websites</em>. While installing and activating modules may be confusing, it sure beats the hell out of coding the functionality from scratch! Anyone who&#8217;s been there will appreciate the advantages of Drupal.</p>

<p>In order to put what we learned into practice, myself and Nathan created <a href="http://andyregan.net/thatsnomoon">a simple website</a> using Drupal. After 10 minutes, we had a nicely themed and secure interactive website ready to be filled with content.</p>

<h3>Find Out More</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in Drupal, a good place to start is by signing up to <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal.org</a> and joining a group such as <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/ireland">Ireland</a>. The Ireland group contains a thread on <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/20936">useful links that were mentioned at DrupalCamp</a>.</p>

<p>Drupal is also well <a href="http://drupal.org/handbooks">documented</a> thanks to contributors like <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/about/addison-berry">Addison Berry</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Fair play to all who created the <a href="http://www.zikomo.org/">Zikomo</a> and <a href="http://www.ruralsa.ie/">RSA</a> sites from scratch on Sunday! Wow.</p>

			Recovering Files From an Unmountable USB Key</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The other night, myself and Rory managed to recover his friend&#8217;s thesis from a wonky USB thumb drive. We used <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">PhotoRec</a> on Ubuntu Linux.
PhotoRec comes with the TestDisk utility. You can install TestDisk via:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$apt</span>-get update
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$apt</span>-get install testdisk
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first thing we did was run <strong>dmesg</strong> in a terminal to get a bit of info on what was going on. We ran dmesg before and after we plugged
in the drive and noted the relevant output. The device eventually settled and was given the device location sdb by the kernel, but no
filesystem was found.
The partition was likely corrupted somehow.</p>

<p>TestDisk could be used to try to repair the partition on the disk, but it could also damage the data further. We decided to make an image to work with using <strong>dd</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Use dd with care! Consult the man page for more info.</strong></p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$sudo</span> dd <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/sdb <span class="nv">ou</span><span class="o">=</span>./disk_image
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This copied the contents of the usb key block-by-block to a file called &#8220;disk_image&#8221;. The was a 2G image (the total capacity) of the wonky drive.</p>

<p>We then used <strong>photorec</strong> to try to recover any files from the image.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$photorec</span> ./disk_image
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Select the image to use.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec1.png" title="Select the image to use" ></p>

<p>Select the partition type.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec2.png" title="Select the partition type" ></p>

<p>Select the partition.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec3.png" title="Select the partition" ></p>

<p>Select the filesystem type.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec4.png" title="Select the filesystem type" ></p>

<p>Select where to save the recovered files.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec5.png" title="Select where to save the recoverd files" ></p>

<p>Watch the search in progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec6.png" title="Search in progress" ></p>

<p>Et voila! PhotoRec worked its magic and we recovered the thesis, along with all the other files.</p>
