			Nasty Site Hack Leads to Phony Google Links</a>

<p><img class="center" src="http://andyregan.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tornado_warning.gif" width="300" title="Warning Sign" alt="Thar be nasty scripts here!"></p>

<p>Came across a dirty (but interesting) website hack today. Essentially when a person googled their domain name they discovered hundreds
and hundreds of phony links pointing to a sub-directory of their site. (With various explicitly charming descriptions).
Clicking on these links displayed a page full of advertisements.</p>

<p>Had a nose around the sub-directory in question and couldn&#8217;t find any files corresponding to the links.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found a rogue PHP script (called <strong>report.php</strong>). Turns out that the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/htaccess.html">.htaccess</a> file in the directory had been modified
to redirect any <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404">404 Not Found</a></strong> errors to the PHP script. Even dirtier still was that when you accessed the script directly in a
browser it showed a typical default 404 error, a tactic I guess is there to add confusion when you are trying to find the cause of the
hack. <strong>Bastards</strong>.</p>

<p>Script was <a href="http://www.wewatchyourwebsite.com/wordpress/?p=136">base64</a>&#8216;d and full of typical randomness meant to slow down those trying to figure out exactly what it&#8217;s trying to do.
As far as I can tell, it just serves up ad pages when it&#8217;s redirected to and the 404 error page when accessed directly.</p>

<p>The ultimate bastardly thing about this hack is that even after you clean up your site, it&#8217;ll be ages before the explicit phony links
dissappear from Google. Another good reason to avoid 777 permissions of directories and keep your web software updated.</p>

<p>Just wanted to make people aware of it. If you come across something similar have a look in the <strong>.htaccess</strong> file first. :)</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>The following bash one-liner can help find any files that contain a call to the base64_encode() method. Some legitimate files may be
included, but this should help narrow down the list of dirty scripts.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>snippet </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$find</span> . -type f | xargs grep -l base64_encode
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>According to RTE there should be plenty of work for me and my classmates when we graduate. Good to hear. (As Forrest Gump would say, &#8220;One less thing, you know?&#8221;.) Unfortunately, from my experience so far this year I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be quite as easy to get a good job in ICT as RTE suggests.</p>

<p>The dramatic reduction in the number of people studying computer sciences courses since the dot-com bust has been no more obvious than in my own course. At the start of this decade, GY350 Information Technology was very much in demand, with hundreds of students and Round 1 CAO points regularly over 400.</p>

<p>Today, there&#8217;s <strong>nine</strong> of us in final year.</p>

<p>What caused the continuous slump in applicants? According to a <a href="http://www.forfas.ie/publications/2008/title,951,en.php">report</a> published last year by Forf&aacute;s, the national policy advisory body for enterprise and science, the mammies and guidance councilors of Ireland share a large part of the blame.</p>

<p>When the numbers of ICT jobs started to fall sharply and graduates found themselves competing to find work the mammies of Ireland took heed. The word was out that the &#8221;<em>computhers</em> game&#8221; was a lame duck.</p>

<p>Nay not so. While fewer positions were available, the revenue generated by the ICT industry continued to grow and after 2004 the number of people employed in ICT began to steadily grow again. However, the stigma of the bust was not forgotten.</p>

<p>Personally, I know a number of people who wanted to study IT but were told &#8220;sure there&#8217;s no jobs in that&#8221; and &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t you study civil engineering and make a fortune like young Gombeen down the road?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re told Ireland doesn&#8217;t have enough IT graduates to meet demand. RTE reports that &#8220;50% of software hires in Dublin are from abroad&#8221; at a time when 4000 people (including many college graduates) are applying for 280 jobs in Ikea.</p>

<p>Aside from worries about job security, I also think that people have a poor understanding of the type of work that an IT student will do once they graduate. When I&#8217;m asked what I&#8217;m studying in college, I generally have to brace myself for the inevitable &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re doing IT? Is there much work fixing computers?&#8221;. (Usually followed by a request to fix a broken printer or laptop. o_0 )</p>

<p>One of the main recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s report is &#8220;better communication of career opportunities and skills needs of the ICT sector &#8220;. I think a good effort is now being made by the government and 3rd level institutions to change people&#8217;s perceptions of ICT. Hopefully, this will lead to more applications over the coming years.</p>

<p>An unexpected side affect of the drop in demand for ICT courses was an increase in the drop out rate. The points for my course bombed from 385 in 2001 to 225 in 2002. The points began to steadily climb again, but in the proceeding years I know that some people applied for the course purely based on the low points requirement. They struggled with the course material and work load. Many failed and either repeated or dropped out.</p>

<p>Other similar courses such as Electronic Engineering experienced the same problems.</p>

<p>All this should be good news to me, right? Less competition and all that? Unfortunately, my pending departure from 3rd level education is coinciding with probably the most dramatic hic-up in the Irish and global economy.</p>

<p>Already, a number of companies well-known for hiring IT graduates have suspended hiring for the rest of the year due to &#8220;the current macro-economic environment&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t hear <em>that</em> mentioned in the RTE report.</p>

<p>I also think some companies are continuing to advertise for jobs not knowing if they will be able to actually take on new hires, probably because they don&#8217;t want to seem weak in the current climate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not expecting to fall out of my degree onto a smorgous board of opportunity waiting to snap me up. (Prove me wrong, world. Prove me wrong.) In fact, I think I&#8217;m going to have to really sell myself to land a good job where I&#8217;ll be competing against people that are out of work and who have a few year&#8217;s experience under their belts.</p>

<p>Are there plenty of jobs out there? I&#8217;m sure there is, but definitely not to the extent reported by RTE last Thursday.</p>

<p>Nathan and I attended <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/18452">DrupalCamp in Galway</a> on Saturday. John Long also made a suprise appearance! It was very well organised and over 60 people attended. Unfortunately, we could only attend on the Saturday. Many thanks and congratulations to the organisers.</p>

<p><a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> is an open source content management system with a very active contributing community. There&#8217;s a huge amount of contributed <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Modules">modules</a> available that allow users to extend the core functionality of the software. As a result, Drupal is extremely flexible and configurable.</p>

<p>Custom themes can also be easily applied. There are many free themes available at <a href="http://themegarden.org/drupal6/">themegarden.org</a>. Here&#8217;s a list of my favourites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/nitobe">nitobe</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/painted">painted</a></li>

<h3>Complexity vs Flexibility</h3>

<p>Unfortunately for new users, the amount of configuration options available is more than a bit overwhelming. I found that performing common tasks in a new install of Drupal is not as obvious as other content management systems, such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> or <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>. Although well organised, the standard administrative interface feels overloaded with text.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to improve usability that were suggested by speakers at DrupalCamp. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu">Administration Menu</a> module provides a nice drop down navigation bar containing common admin tasks that becomes available when an administrator logs in. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rootcandy">RootCandy</a> theme is also an improvement on the default administration theme.</p>

<p>One gotcha when installing new modules is satisfying their dependent modules. You may have to track down and install dependent modules (and their dependent modules!) before you can active the original module you wanted.</p>

<p>While many “newbies” (including myself) complain about the complexity of Drupal, it was mentioned by Alan Burke yesterday that the Drupal developers do not want to improve simplicity at the cost of flexibility. At the end of the day, some basic knowledge of web development is required.</p>

<p>I think some of the group that didn&#8217;t come from a technical background were expecting a kind of <em>Word for Websites</em>. While installing and activating modules may be confusing, it sure beats the hell out of coding the functionality from scratch! Anyone who&#8217;s been there will appreciate the advantages of Drupal.</p>

<p>In order to put what we learned into practice, myself and Nathan created <a href="http://andyregan.net/thatsnomoon">a simple website</a> using Drupal. After 10 minutes, we had a nicely themed and secure interactive website ready to be filled with content.</p>

<h3>Find Out More</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in Drupal, a good place to start is by signing up to <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal.org</a> and joining a group such as <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/ireland">Ireland</a>. The Ireland group contains a thread on <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/20936">useful links that were mentioned at DrupalCamp</a>.</p>

<p>Drupal is also well <a href="http://drupal.org/handbooks">documented</a> thanks to contributors like <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/about/addison-berry">Addison Berry</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Fair play to all who created the <a href="http://www.zikomo.org/">Zikomo</a> and <a href="http://www.ruralsa.ie/">RSA</a> sites from scratch on Sunday! Wow.</p>

			Recovering Files From an Unmountable USB Key</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The other night, myself and Rory managed to recover his friend&#8217;s thesis from a wonky USB thumb drive. We used <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">PhotoRec</a> on Ubuntu Linux.
PhotoRec comes with the TestDisk utility. You can install TestDisk via:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$apt</span>-get update
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$apt</span>-get install testdisk
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first thing we did was run <strong>dmesg</strong> in a terminal to get a bit of info on what was going on. We ran dmesg before and after we plugged
in the drive and noted the relevant output. The device eventually settled and was given the device location sdb by the kernel, but no
filesystem was found.
The partition was likely corrupted somehow.</p>

<p>TestDisk could be used to try to repair the partition on the disk, but it could also damage the data further. We decided to make an image to work with using <strong>dd</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Use dd with care! Consult the man page for more info.</strong></p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$sudo</span> dd <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/sdb <span class="nv">ou</span><span class="o">=</span>./disk_image
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This copied the contents of the usb key block-by-block to a file called &#8220;disk_image&#8221;. The was a 2G image (the total capacity) of the wonky drive.</p>

<p>We then used <strong>photorec</strong> to try to recover any files from the image.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$photorec</span> ./disk_image
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Select the image to use.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec1.png" title="Select the image to use" ></p>

<p>Select the partition type.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec2.png" title="Select the partition type" ></p>

<p>Select the partition.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec3.png" title="Select the partition" ></p>

<p>Select the filesystem type.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec4.png" title="Select the filesystem type" ></p>

<p>Select where to save the recovered files.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec5.png" title="Select where to save the recoverd files" ></p>

<p>Watch the search in progress.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/recovering-files-from-an-unmountable-usb-key/photorec6.png" title="Search in progress" ></p>

<p>Et voila! PhotoRec worked its magic and we recovered the thesis, along with all the other files.</p>

			Webcam Motion Detection in Ubuntu Linux</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I bought a cheap usb webcam to add to the list of devices for my fyp. The idea is to push presence updates when motion is detected. I&#8217;ll be using <a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome">Motion</a> to handle motion detection.
Detailed <a href="http://infectedproject.com/2008/04/11/how-to-part-1-cheap-ubuntu-based-home-security/">installation and configuration instructions</a> can be found at InfectedProject.</p>

<p>You can set motion to run commands when certain events happen, such as an image is saved or a movie ends. For example, you could add the following to <strong>/etc/motion/motion.conf</strong> so that you get an email to you&#8217;re email account when a movie ends.</p>

			Installing Subclipse in Ubuntu Behind a Proxy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Took me ages to figure this out. I followed these <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EclipseSubversion">instructions on how to install Subclise</a>. After I added the remote site and hit &#8220;Finish&#8221; the installer just timed out. I was working behind a firewall (IT LABS!) so I figured proxy settings had something to do with my problems.</p>

<p>Long story short, Eclipse doesn&#8217;t use your global proxy settings. In Ubuntu, the location of the settings in Eclipse is <strong>Window->Preferences->Install &amp; Update</strong>.</p>

<p>From there, you can specify your proxy host and port and successfully install <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a>.</p>

<p>Subclipse is a Subversion plugin for eclipse. Thanks to Nathan for helping me find the settings!</p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a plugin that showed my presence in a way that I liked so I threw together the following php script. It&#8217;s influenced by the <a href="http://www.awflasher.com/blog/" title="Visit plugin homepage">Gtalk (Status) to WordPress (G2W)</a> plugin by Aw Guo. It includes <a href="http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/" title="simplehtmldom">simplehtmldom</a>, a very easy to use HTML DOM parser.</p>

<p>The first step is to get a <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/service/badge/New">Gtalk Chatback Badge</a>. Edit the badge, making sure &#8220;Show your status message&#8221; is ticked. Copy the hashcode in the url of your badge. It&#8217;s the string after after <code>?tk</code>. Replace <code>HASHCODE</code> in the following code with your hashcode.</p>
