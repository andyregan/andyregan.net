    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for visiting! The main purpose of this blog (right now) is as an archive for useful technical bits and pieces I&#8217;ve come across and don&#8217;t want to forget. Hopefully, you might find some of these useful, too. This is my first post and I&#8217;d like to start by sharing a handy little script-foo I learned.</p>

<p>Over Christmas, the Compsoc admin team reinstalled our backup server. We created a fairly large (~3.6T RAID5) /home partition which took forever to build when the server booted for the first time. Rather than keep checking into the server room I figured &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be handy if I could just get a text when the server comes up?&#8221;.</p>

<p>I decided to use a great tool called <a title="o2sms" href="http://o2sms.sourceforge.net/" target="_self">o2sms</a> by <a title="mackers" href="http://www.mackers.com/" target="_self">Mackers</a> that&#8217;s installed on Compsoc&#8217;s webserver. It allows you to send text messages via the command line. The following script intermittently pings the backup and sends an SMS to the specified number when a ping returns successfully:</p>

<p><code>$while ! ping -W 1 -c 1 &lt;IPAddress&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null; do true; done &amp;&amp; echo "Scorpio is UP" | meteorsms &lt;mynumber&gt;</code></p>

<p>Its a simple little diddy ain&#8217;t it? Run it in a screen and you can detach, logout and go about your day. Drop the <strong>!</strong> and it will send an SMS if a ping fails (maybe the servers down). You could also replace ping with another event, such as a certain user logging in (users | grep andrewjregan) or if you recieve a new mail.</p>
