I haven't come across anything that deserves a full post this week, so here's 5 interesting technologies I've come across recently:

*   [umask][1] 
    *   How to set default permissions when creating files in linux
*   [DoHop.com][2] 
    *   Find Cheap Flights
*   [Twubble][3] 
    *   Friends of Friends for Twitter
*   [JTwitter][4] 
    *   Java Library for the Twitter API
*   [TwitterLocal][5] 
    *   Find tweets by location

And here's some more randomness:

*Switching to VoIP* by Ted Wallingford is very related to that 4IF1 are currently studying in Real Time Systems. Chapter 6 in particular.

When ordering books from Amazon, do not screw around during the ordering stage unless you want two of the same book. */me hangs head in shame*.

The 3 wireless dongle works perfectly in Ubuntu.

[World of Goo][6] is a very addictive game.

Finally, congrats to Emma Conway for her win in the NUIG Student Union elections. Unfortunately, Pofla didn't get in.Â  I hoarded as many whispa's as I possibly could to prevent their dispersal to the general populace to no avail.
