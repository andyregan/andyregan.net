[SFQL][1] is a different approach to business networking. Break the ice by playing a few LAN games and having a laugh. Afterwards, head to a nearby pub for some refreshments and have a chance to chat with like-minded people in the tech industry from Galway.

It's happening May 6th from 7pm in Squareyes, Forster St (near Eyre Square). The cost of gaming is &euro;6.

This is a [Digital Media Forum][2] event. The idea was born at the last Digital Media Breakfast in Galway and has been put together thanks to [@antonmannering][3] and [Squareyes][4].

Promises to be good craic! Join via [the event page][1] so we'll have some idea of numbers. Thanks! :)
