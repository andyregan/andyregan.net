I got a bit sick of the old fusion theme. The new theme is based on the [Vigilance Theme][1] by [Jestro][2] with some tweaks suggested in an excellent [article by Dean Peters][3] along with a couple of tweaks of my own. 

Header image is a photo I took atop the [cliff at Silver Strand overlooking Galway Bay][4].

It's a lot cleaner and I think it's easier to read, too. Hope you like it!
